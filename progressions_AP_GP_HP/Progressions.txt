Progressions:

There are three different types of progressions. They are:
1.Arithmetic Progression (AP)
2.Geometric Progression (GP)
3.Harmonic Progression (HP)
A progression is a special type of sequence for which it is possible to obtain a formula for the nth term. 
The Arithmetic Progression is the most commonly used sequence in maths with easy to understand formulas. 
Definition 1: A mathematical sequence in which the difference between two consecutive terms is always a constant and it is abbreviated as AP.
Definition 2: An arithmetic sequence or progression is defined as a sequence of numbers in which for every pair of consecutive terms, 
the second number is obtained by adding a fixed number to the first one.
